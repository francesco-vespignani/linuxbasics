# Basics of linux for data science

A short 5 hours boot course on gnu and linux.

##  Aim of the course

GNU Core Utils are the basic tools to interact with files, folders, and processes in a Unix-based OS. Differently from using Graphical User Interfaces like file browsers, word or excel, these utilities allow for the creation, transformation and adaptation of the files typically used in the scientific research from a terminal shell, without the need of using specialized software or language. The shell language allows for piping different commands, allowing testing and checking immediately the results of these computations. The knowledge of basics of Linux programming is also extremely relevant produce FAIR data (Findable - Accessible - Interoperable - Reusable), accomplishing requirement of the open science paradigm and useful for students interested in using high performance computing facilities.
Skills you will learn during the course:

1) interact with files and with the filesystem using a shell command line terminal.

2) writing simple shell programs.

3) creating and manipulating pdf, html, flac/wav, svg/png, mov files.

4) manipulating text files by finding and replacing complex patterns and extracting specific pieces.

##  What is Linux 

It is not only the kernel done by Linus Torvalds, see [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/) and the [free software foundation](https://www.fsf.org/)

Some words on free software by [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman):

- [free software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag1AKIl_2GM&t)
- [free software and education](https://www.gnu.org/education/education.html)

## Installation:

Stallman says [a beginner shouldn't install linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umQL37AC_YM). You can ask friends or technicians.

You can try by booting your laptop with  a USB stick with  Trisquel GNU/Linux, Debian, Mint, Ubuntu, Gentoo ...

If you want just to play with bash and gnu coreutils in your Windows machine you may wan to install [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).
